# File/Folder Protection Software

## Overview

The **File/Folder Protection Software** is a C++ application designed to protect and restore files and folders by converting them into a Control Panel format. This tool allows users to safeguard sensitive data by making it less accessible and providing a simple, efficient mechanism for file restoration.

## Features

- **File/Folder Protection**: Protect files or folders by converting them into a Control Panel format to prevent unauthorized access.
- **File/Folder Restoration**: Restore protected files or folders back to their original format with a user-friendly interface.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easily interact with the software via a CLI, providing simple commands for file manipulation.

## Installation

To install and run the File/Folder Protection Software:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdalvihasanemon/File-Protection.git
   ```
2. Compile the C++ code:
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
   - Compile using:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o protection_tool
     ```
3. Run the software:
   ```bash
   ./protection_tool
   ```

## Usage

### Protect Folder/File

1. Launch the program:
   ```bash
   ./protection_tool
   ```
2. Select the **Protect** option.
3. Enter the path of the file or folder you wish to protect.
4. Specify a new name for the protected file or folder.
5. The software will convert and encrypt the file/folder into a Control Panel format for protection.

### Unprotect Folder/File

1. Select the **Unprotect** option.
2. Enter the path of the protected file or folder.
3. Provide a new name for the restored file or folder.
4. The software will restore the original file/folder from the Control Panel format.

## Limitations

- **Platform Dependency**: This software is currently designed for specific operating systems, depending on system commands used.
- **Security Concerns**: The protection mechanism uses basic techniques that may not be sufficient for high-security applications. More advanced encryption methods should be considered for highly sensitive data.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The CLI might be challenging for non-technical users. A GUI is planned for future versions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Security**: Implement stronger encryption techniques (e.g., AES) for enhanced protection of files and folders.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Develop compatibility with multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) for wider accessibility.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Build a user-friendly GUI to make the software more accessible for general users.
