
The File/Folder Protection Software is a lightweight tool designed to enhance the security of sensitive files and folders by converting them into a Control Panel format. This software offers users a straightforward command-line interface for protecting and restoring their data.

Users can specify the path of the file or folder they wish to protect, and the software prompts them to provide a new name for the protected entity. The software then converts the specified file or folder into a Control Panel format, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users.

Conversely, users can also restore their protected files or folders back to their original state by specifying the path of the protected entity and providing a new name for the restored file or folder.

While the software provides a basic level of protection, it primarily relies on system commands and file manipulation techniques. Future enhancements could include improving security measures, enhancing cross-platform compatibility, and developing a more user-friendly graphical interface.

Overall, the File/Folder Protection Software offers a simple yet effective solution for safeguarding sensitive data against unauthorized access.
